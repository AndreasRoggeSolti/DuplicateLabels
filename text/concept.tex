\section{General Clustering-Based Duplicate Label Induction Method}
\label{sec:concept}

Our framework consists of three steps: 

\paragraph{Step 1: Define Window and Clustering Technique}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Define Window sizes (1,2,4,8,16)
	\item Define Window shape (left, right, symmetric, pre-post)
	\item Define Influences (uniform, linear decrease, exponential decrease)
	\item Define Clustering method (High-Dimensional clustering with DBSCAN), (Graph Clustering based on Chinese Whispers algorithm~\cite{biemann2006chinese})
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Step 2: Apply Clustering}
Process Log and gather windows per each event. Complexity: Linear in the size of the log.
Apply selected clustering and split event labels according to their clusters in the candidate log. Complexity: DBSCAN (look up), Chinese Whispers (linear in the size of the graph = log size)

\paragraph{Step 3: Select Best Candidate }
\begin{itemize}
	\item Apply fast mining technique and heuristically compute a score based on fitness and precision.
	\item Rank competing methods by score and pick combination with highest score.
	\item Return log with highest score.
\end{itemize}
